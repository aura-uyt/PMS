ðŸ†• Feature Ideas  

    Edit Stored Profile
    
    Password Masking  
        When the user types a password, donâ€™t display it (use getch() on Windows or termios on Linux).  

    Profile Key Hashing  
        Instead of using the key directly for XOR, store a hash of the key (e.g., using SHA256) and only proceed if the entered key matches.  

    Search Credentials  
        Add a feature to search for credentials by website or description.  

    Update Credential  
        Allow the user to update username/password for an existing service.  

    Use JSON instead of raw text (optional but modern):  
        Makes parsing, updating and displaying data much easier and structured.  

    Add Master Password to Enter the App  
        Before accessing menu, require a master password that encrypts/decrypts the rest.
