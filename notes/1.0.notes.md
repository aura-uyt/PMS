# Notes

## File Handling

>use .. to go one level up in a directory  
>use /nameOfDirectory to go to the specific directory  
>use getline() instead of cin to take string as inputs with white spaces
>while defining ofstream make sure to add ios::app (append) for insertion of data without reseting earlier data
