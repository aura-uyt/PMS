# Notes

## File Handling

>use .. to go one level up in a directory  
>use /nameOfDirectory to go to the specific directory  
>use before getline(), cin.ignore(numeric_limits\<streamsize>::max(), '\n');, note remove the '\' before streamline  
 used cin >> somewhere in your code (maybe to take an int or something), which left a newline (\n) in the input buffer. That leftover   newline is  immediately consumed by your first getline(), so it appears as if nothing was entered.  
>use getline() instead of cin to take string as inputs with white spaces
>while defining ofstream make sure to add ios::app (append) for insertion of data without reseting earlier data

## Basic

>modular programming  
>use 'cerr' instead of 'cout' for error messages  
>for(char c: <string/vecotr/..>){} use this simple for loop for these type of parameters  
>size_t is preferred over int for tasks like indexing as it is always non-negative
>a^b(a xor b) can sometimes result in non-displayable characters, hence can use int(<char_var>) to display the characters ascii value
